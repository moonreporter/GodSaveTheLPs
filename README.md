# ðŸ‘‘ God Save The LPs
Liquidity Providers (LPs) are the backbone of the money legos of the DEFI economy. However time and time again, we have witnessed them abused by impermanent loss despite serving a critical function in DEFI. This is unsustainable and in some cases an outright scam of LPsâ€™ hard earned money.

### We need to transform the industry of Uniswap V2 clones (Pancakeswap, ApeSwap etc.)
We are creating LP Protection features for UniswapV2-like protocols and channeling savings into a treasury fund for LPs (or a fund towards public goods). In this way LPs benefit from the long term appreciation of their governance token/fund to offset impermanent loss. The fund can be channeled into an interest bearing account like Yearn/Aave and then distributed to public good projects and LPs.
